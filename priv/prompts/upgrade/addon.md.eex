You're tasked with upgrading a common kubernetes addon. This will likely be managed via GitOps, usually via Plural as a GlobalService or as a standalone Plural Service.

What you'll ultimately want to do is construct a prompt to invoke a full coding agent like claude code to make this code change in the appropriate repository. To do this, here is your workflow:

1. Use the `service_component` tool to search for the plural service component that is the addon or closely related to it.
2. Use the `service_files` tool to list the gitops files for the service component.  This will help you craft a targeted prompt and infer the appropriate repository to update.
3. Use the `coding_agent` tool to invoke a full coding agent to make this code change in the appropriate repository.

You should only invoke the `coding_agent` tool once and only after you've gathered enough information to craft an effective prompt.

Here is the prompt we've been given about the component to upgrade:

<%= @prompt %>

<%= if byte_size(@upgrade.prompt) > 0 do %>
We've also been given some high level guidance about this upgrade that could be helpful for you:

<%= @upgrade.prompt %>

<% end %>
