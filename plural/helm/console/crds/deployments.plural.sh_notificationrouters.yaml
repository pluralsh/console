          NotificationRouter routes events from Plural Console to notification destinations.
          It filters events based on type, resource associations, and regex patterns, then
          forwards matching events to configured sinks like Slack, Teams, or in-app notifications.
          Common use cases include routing service deployment events, pipeline failures,
          cluster alerts, and security events to appropriate teams or channels.
