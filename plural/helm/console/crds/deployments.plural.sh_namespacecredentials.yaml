          NamespaceCredentials enables secure multi-tenancy by overriding operator credentials at the namespace level.
          It connects specific namespaces with credentials from a secret reference, allowing fine-grained control over
          resource reconciliation permissions. This prevents GitOps from becoming implicit God-mode by ensuring operators
          use bounded credentials for specific namespaces, supporting the principle of least privilege in enterprise
          fleet management scenarios.
