          ObservabilityProvider configures external monitoring and observability platforms for use with Plural Console.
          It enables integration with services like Datadog and New Relic to provide enhanced monitoring capabilities
          for infrastructure stacks and service deployments. The provider can be used by InfrastructureStack resources
          to monitor metrics and determine if operations should be cancelled based on system health indicators.
          Common use cases include monitoring deployment health or tracking infrastructure performance metrics.
