          Project provides organizational segmentation and multi-tenancy capabilities within Plural Console.
          It serves as a unit of an organization to control permissions for sets of resources, enabling enterprise-grade
          fleet management while maintaining security boundaries. Projects allow resource owners to manage their
          domain without accessing resources outside their scope, supporting principles of least privilege
          and preventing credential sprawl across the entire fleet.
