# Slack tool setup

Workbench’s Slack integration calls the **Slack Web API** (`https://slack.com/api`) with your app’s **bot user OAuth token** (`xoxb-…`). The backend sends that token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Use this guide to create a Slack app, install it to your workspace, and grant **bot token scopes** that match the built-in Workbench Slack tools (list/find channels, post and edit messages, create channels, invite members, list user groups).

## 1) Create or choose a Slack app

1. Open [Slack API: Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create an app (**From scratch**), or reuse an app you already own.
2. You only need a normal workspace app with a **bot token**; no extra platform features are required beyond OAuth and scopes.

## 2) Bot token and OAuth install

1. Open **OAuth & Permissions**.
2. Under **Scopes** → **Bot Token Scopes**, add the scopes in the next section (or the consolidated list at the end).
3. Install the app to your workspace (**Install to Workspace**).
4. Copy **Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-`). That is the value for the Workbench field **Bot user OAuth token**.

Invite the bot to any **private** channel it should list, post in, or invite others to—the bot only sees private channels it has joined.

## 3) Scopes used by built-in Slack tools

These tools are implemented against the Slack Web API. Add the scopes for each tool you want agents to use; each row links to Slack’s method reference for details.

| Built-in tool (name suffix) | Slack API method | Bot token scopes |
|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| `slack_list_channels_*`, `slack_find_channel_by_name_*` | [`conversations.list`](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list) | `channels:read`, `groups:read` |
| `slack_post_message_*` | [`chat.postMessage`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) | `chat:write` |
| `slack_edit_message_*` | [`chat.update`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.update) | `chat:write` |
| `slack_create_channel_*` | [`conversations.create`](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.create) | `channels:manage` (public channels), `groups:write` (private channels) |
| `slack_invite_to_channel_*` | [`conversations.invite`](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.invite) | `channels:write.invites` (public channels), `groups:write.invites` (private channels). If you pass `usergroup_id`, [`usergroups.users.list`](https://api.slack.com/methods/usergroups.users.list) also runs—use `usergroups:read` (below). |
| `slack_list_user_groups_*` | [`usergroups.list`](https://api.slack.com/methods/usergroups.list) | `usergroups:read` |

### Recommended scope set (all built-in tools)

If you want every built-in Slack tool to work (public and private channels, including invites and user groups), add **all** of these **Bot Token Scopes**:

`chat:write`, `channels:read`, `groups:read`, `channels:manage`, `groups:write`, `channels:write.invites`, `groups:write.invites`, `usergroups:read`

You can omit scopes for features you do not need (for example, skip `usergroups:read` if you never use `slack_list_user_groups_*` or `usergroup_id` on invites).

## 4) Fill the Workbench tool form

- **Bot user OAuth token**: paste the `xoxb-` token from **OAuth & Permissions**.

After saving, associate this tool with a workbench so jobs can use the built-in Slack tools for that connection.
