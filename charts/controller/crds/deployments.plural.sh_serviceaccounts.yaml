          ServiceAccount provides a programmatic identity for automated processes and tools to interact
          with the Plural Console API. Unlike user accounts, service accounts are designed for non-human
          authentication and can be scoped to specific APIs and resources for secure, limited access.
          This enables to authenticate and perform operations within defined permissions boundaries.
