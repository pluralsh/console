          StackDefinition provides reusable templates for Infrastructure Stack configurations and execution steps.
          It allows you to define standardized stack configurations, custom execution steps, and runtime environments
          that can be referenced by multiple Infrastructure Stacks. This enables consistent deployment patterns
          and reduces duplication when managing similar infrastructure components across different environments.
