        control, cancel/resume, better isolation between volume operations, and more
        predictable node-agent resource usage.', fs-backup now supports Windows workloads
        by scheduling data mover pods onto Windows nodes; combined with prior CSI
        data movement support this enables full Windows backup/restore scenarios.,
      Added beta support for Kubernetes VolumeGroupSnapshot for both CSI snapshot
        backup and CSI snapshot data movement to achieve point-in-time consistency
        across multiple volumes., 'PriorityClass can now be configured for Velero
        server, node-agent, data mover pods, and backup repository maintenance jobs
        to influence scheduling/eviction priority.', 'Improved scalability/resiliency
        of data movers: a node-agent PrepareQueueLength can throttle creation of data
        mover pods; data movements can survive node-agent restarts; restore node-selection

        policy now supports reusable include/exclude filters via includeExcludePolicy
        in addition to existing volumePolicy.]

        backups remains supported only until v1.19.', Repository maintenance job configurations
        were removed from Velero server flags; these settings must be provided via
        the repository maintenance job ConfigMap (flags like --keep-latest-maintenance-jobs
        and the maintenance job cpu/memory request/limit flags are gone).]
