    helm_changes: "## Helm values / install-time config changes to check\n\n### 1)\
      \ **Restic uploader removed (breaking)**\n* `--uploader-type=restic` is **no\
      \ longer valid** in v1.17.\n  * If your Helm chart values set anything equivalent\
      \ (commonly `configuration.uploaderType`, `uploaderType`, `deployRestic`, `deployNodeAgent`/`restic`\
      \ toggles, etc.), remove/disable Restic and use the current fs-backup path.\n\
      \  * You can **still restore old Restic-based backups until v1.19**, but you\
      \ cannot create new ones.\n\n### 2) **Repository maintenance job flags removed\
      \ from velero server (breaking)**\nThe following server parameters were removed\
      \ and must be configured via the **repository maintenance job ConfigMap** instead:\n\
      * `--keep-latest-maintenance-jobs`\n* `--maintenance-job-cpu-request`\n* `--maintenance-job-mem-request`\n\
      * `--maintenance-job-cpu-limit`\n* `--maintenance-job-mem-limit`\n\nIf you previously\
      \ set these via chart values that map to `server.extraArgs`, move them to the\
      \ chart\u2019s maintenance-job configmap values (name varies by chart).\n\n\
      ### 3) New/updated **node-agent** configuration knobs worth reviewing\nThese\
      \ are additive but may require Helm values if you want to use them:\n* `PrepareQueueLength`\
      \ (node-agent): throttles creation of data mover pods to avoid large numbers\
      \ stuck Pending.\n* `priorityClassName` support across modules (server, node-agent,\
      \ data mover pods, maintenance jobs): you may want to set these explicitly.\n\
      * Parameterized kubelet mount path for node-agent install (only if you run non-standard\
      \ kubelet paths).\n\n### 4) Modernized fs-backup (architecture change)\nfs-backup\
      \ is now micro-service based. In Helm terms this may translate into:\n* more/changed\
      \ pod templates for data mover / fs-backup components,\n* potential new configmaps/args\
      \ for concurrency/cancel/resume behavior.\n\n(Exact value keys depend on your\
