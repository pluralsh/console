    helm_changes: "## Helm/values changes to plan for (Velero 1.16.0 \u2192 1.17.0)\n\
      \n### 1) **Restic uploader removed (breaking)**\n- `--uploader-type=restic`\
      \ is **no longer valid** in v1.17.\n- If your Helm values set anything equivalent\
      \ to Restic (or you relied on Restic for new backups), remove it and use the\
      \ supported paths (e.g., **kopia**-based file system backup / CSI). You can\
      \ still **restore existing Restic backups** until v1.19.\n\n### 2) **Repository\
      \ maintenance job flags removed from server (breaking)**\nThe following **Velero\
      \ server parameters are removed** in v1.17 and must no longer be set via Helm\
      \ values that map to `configuration.extraArgs` / `server.extraArgs` / similar:\n\
      - `--keep-latest-maintenance-jobs`\n- `--maintenance-job-cpu-request`\n- `--maintenance-job-mem-request`\n\
      - `--maintenance-job-cpu-limit`\n- `--maintenance-job-mem-limit`\n\nThese settings\
      \ are now configured via a **repository maintenance job ConfigMap** (v1.17 adds\
      \ ConfigMap support, with CLI parameter fallback for `keepLatestMaintenanceJobs`).\n\
      \n### 3) **New optional configs you may want to add**\n- **PriorityClass support**\
      \ across server/node-agent/data mover/maintenance jobs: add `priorityClassName`\
      \ values per component if you use workload prioritization.\n- **Node-agent load\
      \ soothing**: new `PrepareQueueLength` in node-agent configuration to limit\
      \ how many data-mover pods/volumes are prepared at once.\n- **Disable pod volume\
      \ host path mount** option for node-agent (if you need to harden or adjust mounts).\n\
      - **Parameterized kubelet mount path** during node-agent installation (if kubelet\
      \ root differs from default).\n- **Node selection for CSI snapshot data movement\
      \ restore**, including per-storage-class selection rules (if you previously\
      \ constrained only backup).\n\n### 4) **Behavioral change to be aware of**\n\
      - PVC restore handling changed: Velero will **always remove** the `selected-node`\
      \ annotation during PVC restore **when no node mapping exists** (previously\
      \ it could be preserved if the node existed). Review if you rely on that scheduling\
      \ behavior."
