  summary:
    helm_changes: "- **Helm chart version alignment:** v2.0.0 notes mention `chore:\
      \ bump charts to 1.3.2` (the chart was updated alongside the app release). Ensure\
      \ your Helm repo/chart version you deploy matches the app version you intend\
      \ (don\u2019t assume app `v2.0.0` implies chart `2.0.0`).\n- **New values supported:**\
      \ `hostAliases` support was added to the chart (`feat(charts): add hostAliases\
      \ support`). If you need custom `/etc/hosts` entries for the controller/webhook\
      \ pods, you can now set them via chart values.\n- **Webhook failurePolicy behavior\
      \ change:** the validating webhook `failurePolicy` for SecretStore is now determined\
      \ dynamically (`Get validating webhook failurePolicy for Secretstore dynamically`).\
      \ If you previously relied on a fixed failurePolicy setting, re-check resulting\
      \ rendered manifests and admission behavior in your cluster.\n"
    chart_updates: [Added `hostAliases` support in the Helm chart (lets you inject
        host aliases into pods)., Validating webhook failurePolicy for SecretStore
        is now determined dynamically (behavior/manifest may differ from prior releases).,
      Chart housekeeping/cleanup and chart version bump noted as part of the release
        process.]
