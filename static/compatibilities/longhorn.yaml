    helm_changes: '### Helm values / upgrade notes

      - **Use the Longhorn Manager hotfix image when targeting v1.10.1:** set the
      manager image tag to `v1.10.1-hotfix-2` (the plain `v1.10.1` manager image has
      known crash/regression issues).

      - **Temporarily disable the upgrade version check if needed:** set `upgradeVersionCheck:
      false` (or `preUpgradeChecker.upgradeVersionCheck: false` depending on your
      chart values) to allow applying the hotfix image and/or performing certain recovery/downgrade
      scenarios.

      - **If upgrading from any v1.9.x to v1.10.x and your cluster may contain `v1beta1`
      stored CRs:** perform the **manual CRD storage version migration** to `v1beta2`
      *before* the Helm upgrade.
