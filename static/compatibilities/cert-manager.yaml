    helm_changes: "## Helm values / chart behavior changes (actionable)\n\n- **`global.rbac.disableHTTPChallengesRole`\
      \ was added in 1.18, then *reverted* in 1.19.0**.\n  - If you set this value\
      \ in 1.18.x, **remove it before/when upgrading to 1.19.0** (it will no longer\
      \ exist / have effect in 1.19.0).\n  - Background: the value was meant to drop\
      \ permissions for creating pods when HTTP-01 isn\u2019t used, but it was rolled\
      \ back.\n\n- **New Helm value: `global.nodeSelector` (1.19.0)**\n  - Lets you\
      \ set a single nodeSelector applied across cert-manager components.\n  - If\
      \ you currently set nodeSelector separately per component, you can optionally\
      \ consolidate to this.\n\n- **Helm template change:** tokenrequest `RoleBinding`\
      \ naming template fixed for consistency (1.19.0).\n  - Typically no action required,\
      \ but expect **resource name changes** which can show up as replace/rename in\
      \ diff.\n\n- **Helm chart quoting change (1.18.0):** nodeSelector values are\
      \ quoted.\n  - Mostly transparent, but can affect strict YAML/value types if\
      \ you relied on non-string types.\n"
