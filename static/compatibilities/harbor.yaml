    chart_updates: [Introduces a replication adapter whitelist to explicitly define
        which replication adapters are actively supported (and therefore allowed).,
      "Replication: optional \u201CSingle Active Replication\u201D mode to prevent\
        \ parallel executions under the same policy.", Proxy-cache behavior improved
        to better synchronize with upstream registries (purges local cache when upstream
        artifacts are deleted; can serve local manifests when digests match upstream).,
      'Artifact scanning enhancements: CVE reports can include fixVersion; vulnerability
        checking behavior improved for non-scannable artifacts.', 'Garbage collection
        UX improvement: shows GC progress while a run is in progress.', 'CNAI (CloudNativeAI)
        integration enhanced: supports raw CNAI model format.', 'Jobservice enhancement:
        retention count for job executions can be customized via environment variable
        (new configurability).', Various component/dependency updates and UI fixes;
        adds Russian language support.]
    features: ["Enhanced proxy-cache: Harbor can delete local cached artifacts when\
        \ they\u2019re removed upstream and can serve a local manifest when its digest\
        \ matches upstream.", Single Active Replication option to ensure only one
        replication execution runs at a time per policy (prevents overlapping parallel
        runs)., 'Enhanced artifact scanning: CVE reports can include fixVersion and
        Harbor can better handle/skip checks for non-scannable artifacts.', 'Enhanced
        garbage collection visibility: GC progress is displayed while GC is running.',
      'Enhanced CNAI model support: raw CNAI model format is now supported.']
    breaking_changes: ['Replication adapter whitelist introduced: deployments may
        need to explicitly allow the replication adapters they use; unsupported/unlisted
        adapters may no longer work until permitted.']

    features: ['Audit log extension: adds a new audit_log_ext table plus API/filtering
        to provide more granular and performant audit event tracking (including login/logout/config/user
        events).', 'Enhanced OIDC: adds PKCE support and improves logout/session handling
        and related audit logging.', 'Redis TLS support: Harbor core/jobservice can
        now connect to Redis over TLS (including external Redis TLS options).', 'CloudNativeAI
        integration: introduces a CNAI model processor and a new AI Model artifact
        type for managing AI model artifacts.', 'Enhanced Dragonfly/P2P preheating:
        extends preheat policies with new parameters, scope customization, and targeting
        (useful for large AI model images).']
    breaking_changes: [CSRF key generation changed; existing deployments may need
        to regenerate/rotate CSRF-related secrets to avoid login/session issues after
        upgrade., Removed the with_signature option; any automation or integrations
        relying on it must be updated/removed., 'RBAC change: Project maintainers/developers/guests
        can no longer list project logs; only higher-privilege roles can access those
        logs now.', robotV1 removed from the codebase (deprecation realized); any
        clients/scripts using legacy robot APIs must migrate to the newer robot account
        model.]
