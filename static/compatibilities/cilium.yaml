      other CNIs such as Istio).

      - **CNI chaining supported via `cni.chainingTarget`.** If you previously used
      custom chaining approaches, confirm your intended chaining target.

      - **Helm chart can configure `kvstoremesh`.** If you use clustermesh at scale,
      review/enable the new `kvstoremesh` settings.

      - **Helm chart changes around clustermesh CA/TLS configuration.** Notes mention
      deprecating clustermesh CA config in favor of global CA config and simplifying
      TLS configuration; review your `clustermesh.*` / global CA values.

      \ CNI or other plugins), review and set `cni.exclusive` and/or `cni.chainingTarget`\
      \ appropriately.\n\n- **kube-proxy replacement value semantics**\n  - The release\
      \ notes mention deprecating `--kpr=partial|strict|disabled` in favor of `--kpr=true|false`,\
      \ and then a revert of that deprecation is listed. Practical takeaway: **double-check\
      \ what your chart version expects** for `kubeProxyReplacement` / `--kube-proxy-replacement`\
      \ to avoid a mismatch during upgrade.\n\n- **New component / chart support:\
      \ kvstoremesh**\n  - Helm chart now supports configuring **kvstoremesh** (a\
      \ companion to clustermesh-apiserver).\n  - Action: if you run ClusterMesh at\
      \ scale or want improved scalability, review new kvstoremesh values and whether\
      \ you should enable it.\n\n- **Ingress/Gateway API and L7 proxy validation**\n\
      \  - There is explicit validation that enabling Ingress or Gateway API while\
      \ L7 proxy is disabled is invalid.\n  - Action: if you use Ingress/Gateway API,\
      \ ensure `l7Proxy` (Envoy) is enabled.\n\n- **Independent Envoy DaemonSet (optional\
      \ new deployment model)**\n  - Cilium can deploy L7 proxy (Envoy) **as a separate\
      \ DaemonSet**.\n  - Action: consider whether to adopt this for availability/performance;\
      \ if not, keep default co-located model.\n\n- **Endpoint CRD Helm option type\
      \ change (watch for values file drift)**\n  - `enableEndpointCRD` type changed\
      \ from **string to boolean**.\n  - Action: ensure your values use `true|false`,\
      \ not quoted strings.\n\n- **Image digests made optional/configurable**\n  -\
      \ \u201Cmake image digests optional & configurable\u201D is listed; if you previously\
      \ relied on pinned digests, confirm your chart values around `useDigest` / digests\
      \ align with your supply-chain policy.\n\n- **CA bundle / webhook CA handling\
      \ improvements**\n  - Chart adds support for specifying a CA bundle and allowing\
      \ `caBundle` to come from a Secret.\n  - Action: if you have custom PKI for\
      \ webhooks/API services, review these new options.\n"

    helm_changes: "## Helm / values changes to review\n\nFrom the provided release\
      \ notes, these are the Helm-facing changes most likely to affect your `values.yaml`\
      \ when moving from **Cilium 1.10.8 \u2192 1.11.0**:\n\n- **New/changed default\
      \ behaviors (double-check your current config):**\n  - **kube-proxy replacement\
      \ is disabled by default** in 1.11 (`install: Disable kube-proxy-replacement\
      \ by default`). If you rely on kube-proxy replacement, you must explicitly set\
      \ it.\n  - **Bandwidth Manager is disabled by default** (`helm: Disable the\
      \ bandwidth manager by default`). If you previously relied on it being enabled,\
      \ set it explicitly.\n  - **BPF masquerading disabled in v1.10+** is reiterated\
      \ (`helm: Disable BPF masquerading in v1.10+`). Ensure your masquerading configuration\
      \ matches expectations.\n\n- **New Helm options / knobs:**\n  - **Disable CRD\
      \ registration by the operator**: New Helm option to prevent the operator from\
      \ registering CRDs (`Add Helm option to disable registering CRD from Cilium\
      \ Operator`). This matters if you manage CRDs separately (GitOps, locked-down\
      \ clusters).\n  - **`disable-endpoint-crd` option support**: Helm support added\
      \ (`helm: Add support for disable-endpoint-crd option`). Relevant if you want\
      \ to avoid the legacy CiliumEndpoint CRD in favor of newer constructs.\n  -\
      \ **Probe timers configurable via Helm** (`Allow configuration of probe timers\
      \ in Helm chart`).\n  - **Expose L2 neighbor discovery related agent flags via\
      \ Helm** (`helm: Expose l2 neigh discovery related agent flags`).\n  - **ServiceMonitor\
      \ custom labels and annotations**:\n    - 1.10.8: add values for **custom ServiceMonitor\
      \ annotations**.\n    - 1.11: allow **custom labels** on ServiceMonitors for\
      \ cilium-agent/operator/hubble.\n\n- **Chart behavior / compatibility adjustments:**\n\
      \  - **CronJob apiVersion switched to `batch/v1` for Kubernetes >= 1.21** (`helm:\
      \ Use batch/v1 apiVersion for CronJob in K8s 1.21+`). Important if you have\
      \ older clusters or strict API policy checks.\n  - **Hubble UI / cert generation:**\
      \ multiple Helm-related fixes and enhancements (standalone UI install, TLS cert\
      \ generation, cert-manager integration). If you enable Hubble UI, re-validate\
      \ the generated resources and RBAC.\n\n- **Config / flag renames you may have\
      \ surfaced through Helm values:**\n  - **Egress gateway flag rename**: `--egress-gateway`\
      \ renamed to **`enable-ipv4-egress-gateway`** (called out as `option: Rename\
      \ egress gateway flag to enable-ipv4-egress-gateway`). If you set the old flag\
      \ via Helm `extraConfig`/`extraArgs`, update it.\n  - **nativeRoutingCIDR deprecation\
      \ / rename**: docs indicate moving to **`ipv4NativeRoutingCIDR`** (`doc: use\
      \ ipv4NativeRoutingCIDR instead of nativeRoutingCIDR`). If you set `nativeRoutingCIDR`\

    helm_changes: "## Helm / values changes to watch\n\nFrom the notes you provided,\
      \ there are **no explicit Helm value changes required specifically between 1.9.0\
      \ \u2192 1.9.12** (most 1.9.12 items are bugfixes and image updates).\n\nHowever,\
      \ **1.9.0 itself introduced major Helm chart changes** that matter if you are\
      \ *actually coming from an older chart layout*:\n\n- **Single consolidated `cilium`\
      \ chart (no subcharts)** and lots of values were re-scoped. If your current\
      \ install was created with the pre-1.9 chart structure, you must follow the\
      \ 1.9 upgrade guide and review your values for renamed/moved keys.\n- **Helm\
      \ 2 support removed; Helm 3 required**.\n- **PodSecurityPolicy removed from\
      \ the chart** (Kubernetes PSP deprecation).\n\nOther Helm-related items mentioned\
      \ in the 1.9.0 notes (verify if you use them):\n\n- **Hubble ingress template\
      \ updated** for newer Kubernetes Ingress APIs.\n- **Load balancer related Helm\
      \ parameters were renamed** (the note references a rename; validate your `values.yaml`\
      \ if you configure kube-proxy replacement / NodePort / LB settings).\n- The\
      \ installation docs mention **hubble-ui image reference fixes** and repository\
      \ changes (ensure your Helm values don\u2019t pin old hubble-ui image repos/tags).\n"
