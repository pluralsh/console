      **Practical Helm upgrade checks to perform anyway (common for patch upgrades):**

      - Confirm you are pinning images by tag or digest as intended; 1.18.5 publishes
      updated digests for all images.

      - Re-run `helm diff upgrade` to catch any chart-side RBAC/Deployment template
      changes that could require extra permissions or restarts.

      - If you use ClusterMesh API server or KVStoreMesh, validate service/port bindings
      and TLS CA bundle settings after upgrade (see bugfixes below).

    chart_updates: [Envoy sidecar/proxy version bumps within the 1.18 patch line (Envoy
        upgraded to v1.34.11 and v1.34.12 by 1.18.5)., ClusterMesh API Server sidecar
        etcd now listens on all IP addresses (binding behavior change)., 'RBAC fix:
        cilium-agent ClusterRole allows missing verbs when `readSecretsOnlyFromSecretsNamespace=false`
        (permissions correctness fix).', Image digests updated for the 1.18.4/1.18.5
        patch line (supply-chain/immutability update).]

    helm_changes: "### Helm values / install behavior changes to review\n\n* **Removed\
      \ Helm values:** `enableK8sEventHandover` and `enableCnpStatusUpdates` were\
      \ removed in 1.15, along with the underlying flags (`--enable-k8s-event-handover`\
      \ in the agent and `--cnp-status-update-interval` in the operator). If your\
      \ current `values.yaml` sets these, **delete them before upgrading**.\n* **kubeProxyReplacement\
      \ value semantics:** the chart now prefers using `kubeProxyReplacement=true`\
      \ (boolean style) instead of the older `strict` string usage. Verify your current\
      \ setting and test that the rendered config matches your intent.\n* **Deprecated\
      \ tunnel option removed:** the deprecated `tunnel` option and its Helm value\
      \ are removed in 1.15. If you were setting `tunnel`, migrate to the newer routing/tunnel\
      \ settings (e.g., `routingMode` / `tunnelProtocol`, depending on your deployment\
      \ model).\n* **SPIRE Helm values schema change:** SPIRE image configuration\
      \ was aligned to match other chart image settings. If you customize SPIRE images/tags/registry,\
      \ re-check those values after upgrading.\n* **New/expanded Helm knobs you may\
      \ want to set:**\n  * Ability to pass Kubernetes API rate limit settings via\
      \ Helm values.\n  * SecurityContext support for SPIRE pods.\n  * Optional `jobLabel`\
      \ for ServiceMonitors (agent/operator/hubble) to match your Prometheus labeling\
      \ conventions.\n  * New knobs for Ingress proxy protocol / trusted hops (if\
      \ you use Cilium Ingress).\n  * Extra volume mounts for the cilium config init\
      \ container.\n\n### Operational / rollout considerations (chart-driven)\n\n\
      * **clustermesh-apiserver + kvstoremesh image changes:** 1.15 merges clustermesh-apiserver\
      \ and kvstoremesh into a single image. If you run clustermesh/kvstoremesh, ensure\
      \ your image overrides, security policies, and registries allow the updated\
      \ image.\n* **Operator & clustermesh kvstore metrics enabled by default:** expect\
      \ additional Prometheus series unless you explicitly disable them.\n"
    chart_updates: [Removed deprecated clustermesh CA configuration from the Helm
        chart (use the global CA configuration instead)., Merged `clustermesh-apiserver`
        and `kvstoremesh` into a single image artifact., Updated/expanded ServiceMonitor
        support (jobLabel option; Envoy-in-agent scraping via ServiceMonitor)., Added
        Helm support for preflight resource annotations and additional init-container
        volume mounts., Updated SPIRE templating and aligned SPIRE image configuration
        schema with other chart images., Removed deprecated tunnel-related Helm value
        and corresponding config generation.]
    features: ['Gateway API support upgraded to v1.0, including GRPCRoute support
        and additional GatewayClass/status capabilities.', ClusterMesh scalability
        can be extended up to 511 clusters (requires consistent configuration across
        all clusters and reduces cluster-local identity space)., Dynamic flow log
        exporters can be configured via ConfigMap without restarting the agent., 'Egress
        Gateway behavior changed to BPF-based interface selection, removing the need
        for `--install-egress-gateway-routes` in supported setups.', 'LB-IPAM allocator
        was replaced and now supports shared IPs, enabling new LB-IPAM capabilities.',
      'Hubble gained new filtering/redaction features (HTTP headers/URLs, Kafka API
        key redaction), new dashboards, and better peer connection metrics.', Support
        added for newer Kubernetes versions (1.28 and 1.29 mentioned in notes)., WireGuard
        improvements including strict mode for pod-to-pod encryption and configurable
        keepalive.]
    breaking_changes: [Helm values `enableK8sEventHandover` and `enableCnpStatusUpdates`
        (and their corresponding agent/operator flags) were removed; upgrades will
        fail or silently ignore config if you keep them in `values.yaml`., The deprecated
        `tunnel` configuration option and related Helm value were removed; configurations
        must use the newer routing/tunnel settings instead., Egress Gateway no longer
        relies on `--install-egress-gateway-routes` (interface selection moved to
        BPF); operational behavior and required host routing assumptions may differ
        from 1.14., 'clustermesh-apiserver/kvstoremesh packaging changed (single image),
        which may require updating image overrides, registries, and security policies.',
      '`EnableRemoteNodeIdentity` was deprecated (planned removal in 1.16); if you
        depend on it, plan a migration now rather than later.']

  summary:
    helm_changes: "## Helm chart / values changes to review\n\nThese are the **Helm\
      \ values changes called out in the 1.14.0 release notes you pasted** that can\
      \ impact an upgrade from 1.13.x.\n\n### Authentication / SPIRE defaults\n- **Default\
      \ changed:** `authentication.mutual.spire.install.enabled` now defaults to **`true`**.\n\
      \  - Impact: Upgrading without overriding this value may install/enable SPIRE\
      \ components (or related resources) in clusters where you did not previously\
      \ run them.\n  - Action: Decide if you want SPIRE installed; if not, set it\
      \ explicitly to `false`.\n\n### CNI chaining / CNI file management behavior\n\
      - New/changed behavior related to how Cilium manages the CNI config file:\n\
      \  - **`cni.exclusive=false`** now disables Cilium \u201Coverwriting\u201D changes\
      \ to its CNI config file. This is relevant when you chain other plugins after\
      \ Cilium (e.g., Istio).\n  - **New:** `cni.chainingTarget` allows chaining with\
      \ **arbitrary** CNI plugins.\n  - Action: If you use CNI chaining today (aws-cni,\
      \ Istio, Multus, etc.), review `cni.exclusive` and whether you should set `cni.chainingTarget`.\n\
      \n### kube-proxy replacement value/flag handling\n- Notes indicate a change/deprecation\
      \ around kube-proxy replacement flags (KPR) (there is also a revert mentioned\
      \ later in the notes).\n  - Action: **Do not assume old values are accepted**;\
      \ verify your current `kubeProxyReplacement` Helm value against the 1.14 chart\
      \ reference before upgrading.\n\n### Ingress / Gateway API validation\n- Chart\
      \ now **validates** that enabling Ingress or Gateway API while `l7Proxy` is\
      \ disabled is invalid.\n  - Action: If you deploy Ingress/Gateway, ensure L7\
      \ proxy is enabled (or be prepared for the Helm upgrade to fail validation).\n\
      \n### KVStoreMesh\n- Helm chart is extended to allow configuring **`kvstoremesh`**.\n\
      \  - Action: Only relevant if you run clustermesh at scale and want/need kvstoremesh;\
      \ otherwise leave disabled.\n\n### CA bundle and TLS-related helm options\n\
      - Chart gained support for specifying a **CA bundle** (including using a Secret\
      \ for `caBundle`).\n- clustermesh peer TLS configuration was simplified; clustermesh\
      \ CA configuration was deprecated in favor of global CA configuration.\n  -\
      \ Action: If you use clustermesh with custom TLS/CA, compare your existing values\
      \ with the new model.\n\n### Other value hygiene / deprecations\n- \u201CClean\
      \ up deprecated values\u201D and removal of `hubble.tls.ca` are mentioned.\n\
      \  - Action: Run `helm upgrade --dry-run` and/or compare your values file to\
      \ the new chart\u2019s `values.yaml` to catch removed keys.\n\n### Type change\
      \ called out\n- `enableEndpointCRD` Helm option type changed **from string to\
      \ boolean**.\n  - Action: If you set it as a quoted string (e.g., `\"true\"\
      `), update it to a boolean (`true`/`false`) to avoid template/type issues.\n"
    chart_updates: [Adds support for deploying the Cilium L7 proxy (Envoy) as an independent
        DaemonSet (separate from the agent) for availability/performance/security.,
      Adds support for kvstoremesh configuration in the Helm chart (new companion
        component for clustermesh scalability)., Adds/updates Helm validations to
        fail installs where Ingress or Gateway API is enabled while L7 proxy is disabled.,
      Updates default behavior around CNI config management; Helm now exposes knobs
        for broader CNI chaining scenarios., 'Refactors/cleans up deprecated chart
        values and TLS/CA handling, especially for clustermesh-related configuration.']
    features: [WireGuard host-to-host and LoadBalancer encryption support (new encryption
        capabilities besides IPsec)., L2 announcement feature (including gratuitous
        ARP support) for advertising service IPs at L2 in certain environments., IPv4
        BIG TCP support (performance improvement similar to prior IPv6 BIG TCP).,
      High-scale ipcache mode aimed at very large clustermeshes (millions of pods).,
      kvstoremesh component to cache remote cluster info in the local kvstore for
        better clustermesh scalability., Ability to deploy Envoy (L7 proxy) as a separate
        DaemonSet., Kubernetes 1.27 support., New mTLS/auth capabilities (SPIFFE-based
        modes) for Cilium Network Policy and Gateway API TLSRoute support.]

    helm_changes: "## Helm / values changes to review\n\nFrom the provided release\
      \ notes, these are the Helm-facing changes most likely to affect your `values.yaml`\
      \ when moving from **Cilium 1.10.8 \u2192 1.11.0**:\n\n- **New/changed default\
      \ behaviors (double-check your current config):**\n  - **kube-proxy replacement\
      \ is disabled by default** in 1.11 (`install: Disable kube-proxy-replacement\
      \ by default`). If you rely on kube-proxy replacement, you must explicitly set\
      \ it.\n  - **Bandwidth Manager is disabled by default** (`helm: Disable the\
      \ bandwidth manager by default`). If you previously relied on it being enabled,\
      \ set it explicitly.\n  - **BPF masquerading disabled in v1.10+** is reiterated\
      \ (`helm: Disable BPF masquerading in v1.10+`). Ensure your masquerading configuration\
      \ matches expectations.\n\n- **New Helm options / knobs:**\n  - **Disable CRD\
      \ registration by the operator**: New Helm option to prevent the operator from\
      \ registering CRDs (`Add Helm option to disable registering CRD from Cilium\
      \ Operator`). This matters if you manage CRDs separately (GitOps, locked-down\
      \ clusters).\n  - **`disable-endpoint-crd` option support**: Helm support added\
      \ (`helm: Add support for disable-endpoint-crd option`). Relevant if you want\
      \ to avoid the legacy CiliumEndpoint CRD in favor of newer constructs.\n  -\
      \ **Probe timers configurable via Helm** (`Allow configuration of probe timers\
      \ in Helm chart`).\n  - **Expose L2 neighbor discovery related agent flags via\
      \ Helm** (`helm: Expose l2 neigh discovery related agent flags`).\n  - **ServiceMonitor\
      \ custom labels and annotations**:\n    - 1.10.8: add values for **custom ServiceMonitor\
      \ annotations**.\n    - 1.11: allow **custom labels** on ServiceMonitors for\
      \ cilium-agent/operator/hubble.\n\n- **Chart behavior / compatibility adjustments:**\n\
      \  - **CronJob apiVersion switched to `batch/v1` for Kubernetes >= 1.21** (`helm:\
      \ Use batch/v1 apiVersion for CronJob in K8s 1.21+`). Important if you have\
      \ older clusters or strict API policy checks.\n  - **Hubble UI / cert generation:**\
      \ multiple Helm-related fixes and enhancements (standalone UI install, TLS cert\
      \ generation, cert-manager integration). If you enable Hubble UI, re-validate\
      \ the generated resources and RBAC.\n\n- **Config / flag renames you may have\
      \ surfaced through Helm values:**\n  - **Egress gateway flag rename**: `--egress-gateway`\
      \ renamed to **`enable-ipv4-egress-gateway`** (called out as `option: Rename\
      \ egress gateway flag to enable-ipv4-egress-gateway`). If you set the old flag\
      \ via Helm `extraConfig`/`extraArgs`, update it.\n  - **nativeRoutingCIDR deprecation\
      \ / rename**: docs indicate moving to **`ipv4NativeRoutingCIDR`** (`doc: use\
      \ ipv4NativeRoutingCIDR instead of nativeRoutingCIDR`). If you set `nativeRoutingCIDR`\
      \ in Helm, plan to migrate.\n\n> Note: the provided content is *application*\
