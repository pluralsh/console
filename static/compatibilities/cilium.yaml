      \ you provided (mostly Cilium 1.15 changelog items that mention Helm):\n\n-\
      \ **Removed Helm values** (must be deleted from your values file if present):\n\
      \  - `enableK8sEventHandover`\n  - `enableCnpStatusUpdates`\n\n- **Default change**:\n\
      \  - `kubeProxyReplacement` Helm value now prefers/uses `true` instead of the\
      \ older `strict` wording (older docs/values may use `strict`).\n\n- **Tunnel-related\
      \ cleanup**:\n  - A **deprecated tunnel option** and the corresponding Helm\
      \ value were removed. If you set a tunnel option that was previously marked\
      \ deprecated, you\u2019ll need to migrate to the current tunnel configuration\
      \ knobs supported by 1.16.\n\n- **SPIRE Helm values layout**:\n  - SPIRE image\
      \ values were **restructured** \u201Cto match other images\u201D. If you override\
      \ SPIRE images (repository/tag/digest), verify your overrides still apply after\
      \ upgrading.\n  - Helm now supports using an **existing SPIRE namespace**.\n\
      \n- **Observability defaults**:\n  - Some metrics for operator / clustermesh\
      \ components were enabled by default in Helm (if you previously assumed they\
      \ were off, ensure Prometheus scraping and resource usage are acceptable).\n\
      \n- **New/expanded Helm knobs mentioned in 1.15 notes** (verify if you rely\
      \ on these and whether defaults changed):\n  - `apiRateLimit` can be passed\
      \ via Helm values.\n  - `hubble-exporter` supports filter/field mask configuration.\n\
      \  - `certgen` job can be configured with affinity.\n  - `install-cni` container\
      \ resources are configurable.\n  - Preflight resources allow annotations.\n\

      \ scraping via the chart).\n\n- **Extra containers for cilium-agent DaemonSet**\n\

      \ notes, these are the Helm-facing changes most likely to affect your `values.yaml`\
      \ when moving from **Cilium 1.10.8 \u2192 1.11.0**:\n\n- **New/changed default\
      \ behaviors (double-check your current config):**\n  - **kube-proxy replacement\
      \ is disabled by default** in 1.11 (`install: Disable kube-proxy-replacement\
      \ by default`). If you rely on kube-proxy replacement, you must explicitly set\
      \ it.\n  - **Bandwidth Manager is disabled by default** (`helm: Disable the\
      \ bandwidth manager by default`). If you previously relied on it being enabled,\
      \ set it explicitly.\n  - **BPF masquerading disabled in v1.10+** is reiterated\
      \ (`helm: Disable BPF masquerading in v1.10+`). Ensure your masquerading configuration\
      \ matches expectations.\n\n- **New Helm options / knobs:**\n  - **Disable CRD\
      \ registration by the operator**: New Helm option to prevent the operator from\
      \ registering CRDs (`Add Helm option to disable registering CRD from Cilium\
      \ Operator`). This matters if you manage CRDs separately (GitOps, locked-down\
      \ clusters).\n  - **`disable-endpoint-crd` option support**: Helm support added\
      \ (`helm: Add support for disable-endpoint-crd option`). Relevant if you want\
      \ to avoid the legacy CiliumEndpoint CRD in favor of newer constructs.\n  -\
      \ **Probe timers configurable via Helm** (`Allow configuration of probe timers\
      \ in Helm chart`).\n  - **Expose L2 neighbor discovery related agent flags via\
      \ Helm** (`helm: Expose l2 neigh discovery related agent flags`).\n  - **ServiceMonitor\
      \ custom labels and annotations**:\n    - 1.10.8: add values for **custom ServiceMonitor\
      \ annotations**.\n    - 1.11: allow **custom labels** on ServiceMonitors for\
      \ cilium-agent/operator/hubble.\n\n- **Chart behavior / compatibility adjustments:**\n\
      \  - **CronJob apiVersion switched to `batch/v1` for Kubernetes >= 1.21** (`helm:\
      \ Use batch/v1 apiVersion for CronJob in K8s 1.21+`). Important if you have\
      \ older clusters or strict API policy checks.\n  - **Hubble UI / cert generation:**\
      \ multiple Helm-related fixes and enhancements (standalone UI install, TLS cert\
      \ generation, cert-manager integration). If you enable Hubble UI, re-validate\
      \ the generated resources and RBAC.\n\n- **Config / flag renames you may have\
      \ surfaced through Helm values:**\n  - **Egress gateway flag rename**: `--egress-gateway`\
      \ renamed to **`enable-ipv4-egress-gateway`** (called out as `option: Rename\
      \ egress gateway flag to enable-ipv4-egress-gateway`). If you set the old flag\
      \ via Helm `extraConfig`/`extraArgs`, update it.\n  - **nativeRoutingCIDR deprecation\
      \ / rename**: docs indicate moving to **`ipv4NativeRoutingCIDR`** (`doc: use\
      \ ipv4NativeRoutingCIDR instead of nativeRoutingCIDR`). If you set `nativeRoutingCIDR`\

    helm_changes: "## Helm chart / values changes to watch\nFrom the provided 1.10.0\
      \ notes (and still relevant when you land on 1.10.7), there are several Helm-value\
      \ structure changes and new knobs that commonly trip upgrades:\n\n- **Do not\
      \ use `helm --reuse-values` for upgrades.** The 1.10.7 notes explicitly warn\
      \ against it; use an explicit values file (or `helm get values ...` into a file\
      \ and edit) so you don\u2019t accidentally keep deprecated/renamed fields.\n\
      - **`extraArgs` format changed**: Helm **replaced object-based `extraArgs` with\
      \ an array-based format**. If you previously had `extraArgs: { foo: \"bar\"\
      \ }`, you must convert to the new list style.\n- **Encryption values restructured**:\n\
      \  - Helm **consolidated IPSec and WireGuard options** under a common encryption\
      \ hierarchy.\n  - **IPSec options moved under `encryption.ipsec`** (older top-level\
      \ ipsec keys need mapping).\n- **New top-level `eni` block for AWS ENI IPAM**\
      \ with more options; also includes `eni.iamRole` to support IAM roles for service\
      \ accounts on the operator.\n- **`kubeProxyReplacement` behavior changed for\
      \ new installs**: quick-install default became **disabled by default**, so make\
      \ sure your existing setting is explicitly set to what you expect.\n- **New/changed\
      \ optional toggles you may want to set explicitly** (depending on your deployment):\n\
      \  - `enableEgressGateway` (enables egress gateway feature)\n  - `enable-ipv6-masquerade`\
      \ agent option when using iptables masquerade mode\n  - `proxy.prometheus.enabled`\
      \ (can disable the proxy metrics service)\n  - Support for **external serviceAccounts**\
      \ (if you manage RBAC externally)\n\nIf you share your current `values.yaml`,\
      \ we can map old keys to new ones precisely."
    chart_updates: ['Cilium 1.10 introduced multiple Helm chart refactors that still

      \ are the Helm-facing changes explicitly mentioned in the 1.10.0 release notes\
      \ and are the ones most likely to require changes to your `values.yaml`.\n\n\
      - **`extraArgs` format changed**: Helm **replaced object-based `extraArgs` with\
      \ array-based**.\n  - If you had something like:\n    ```yaml\n    extraArgs:\n\
      \      debug: \"true\"\n      devices: \"eth0\"\n    ```\n    you\u2019ll need\

      \ **consolidated IPsec and WireGuard encryption options**.\n  - Helm **moved\
      \ IPsec options under `encryption.ipsec`**.\n  - If you previously set top-level\
      \ IPsec-related values, you must relocate them under the new `encryption` tree.\n\
      \n- **New Helm toggles / options**:\n  - `enableEgressGateway` was added.\n\
      \  - `enable-k8s-event-handover` can now be configured via Helm.\n  - `proxy.prometheus.enabled`\
      \ flag added to disable the proxy Prometheus service.\n  - `EndpointStatus`\
      \ enablement added to Helm chart.\n  - `serviceAccounts.*.create` is respected\
      \ (ensure your values align with the intended SA creation behavior).\n  - External\
      \ ServiceAccounts are now supported (you can point to pre-created SAs).\n\n\
      - **Image digest controls**:\n  - Helm added **digest flags** to pin images\
      \ by digest (useful for reproducible upgrades / restricted registries).\n\n\
      - **ENI values schema change**:\n  - Helm created a **top-level `eni` block**\
      \ and added more ENI options.\n  - `eni.iamRole` option was added to allow using\
      \ IAM roles for service accounts on `cilium-operator`.\n\n- **TLS secret content**:\n\
