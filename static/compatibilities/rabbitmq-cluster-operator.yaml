        upgrading the cluster-operator can trigger rolling updates of managed RabbitMQ
        StatefulSets. If you need to control timing, pause reconciliation on RabbitMQCluster
        resources before upgrading, then resume when safe.', '**Image/packaging changes:**
        v2.1.0 introduced multi-arch (amd64/arm64) operator image; v2.2.0 continues
        image pipeline changes (including arm64 image generation and some single-arch
        pipeline work/reverts).', '**RBAC additions:** v2.1.0 added an Aggregating

        override `StatefulSet.spec.persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy` for PVC retention
        behavior on scale/down or delete., Operator now opens the stream port automatically
        when the stream management plugin is enabled.]
    breaking_changes: [Default RabbitMQ image/version used by the operator was bumped
        (to 3.11.10-management) which can change the RabbitMQ version you deploy if
        you rely on operator defaults; pin your RabbitMQ image/version explicitly
        if you need to avoid an unplanned RabbitMQ upgrade., "Operator image selection/control\
        \ behavior changed (\u201Clet rabbitmq operator to control images\u201D);\
