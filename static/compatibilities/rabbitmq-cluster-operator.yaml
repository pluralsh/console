    chart_updates: [Operator can now control images used for RabbitMQ clusters (image
        selection/override logic changed)., Supports overriding `StatefulSet.spec.persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy`
        for managed clusters., Opens the stream port automatically when the stream
        management plugin is enabled., Default RabbitMQ version image tag bumped (now
        3.11.10-management); additional logic to pin/patch version to avoid unintended
        RabbitMQ upgrades., Logging noise reduced by moving verbose lines to debug
        level., Build/release pipeline updates including multi-arch/single-arch image
        generation adjustments (arm64 added/validated).]
    features: [Override `PersistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy` on the RabbitMQ StatefulSet

        the RabbitMQ stream port when the stream management plugin is enabled., Improved
        image handling so the operator can manage/choose images more directly (reduces
        external wiring).]

        if you rely on defaults.', 'If you previously injected/controlled images via

        adjusting your configuration to avoid drift.']
