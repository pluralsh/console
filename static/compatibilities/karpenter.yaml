  summary:
    helm_changes: "## Helm/values changes to check before upgrading\n- **`settings.clusterName`\
      \ is now required**: the chart will **fail to install/upgrade** if this value\
      \ is not set. Ensure your `values.yaml` (or `--set`) includes it.\n- **ServiceMonitor\
      \ enhancements**: if you use the chart\u2019s `ServiceMonitor`, you can now\
      \ configure **`relabelings`** and **`metricRelabelings`**. No change required\
      \ unless you want to use these new fields.\n- **Default security context updated**:\
      \ the chart improved the **default pod/container security context**. If you\
      \ have strict Pod Security Admission / PSP-style policies, verify the rendered\
      \ manifests still comply with your cluster\u2019s requirements.\n- **runAsNonRoot\
      \ removed in chart**: the chart **removed `runAsNonRoot`** to support more restricted\
      \ pod security profiles. If you relied on `runAsNonRoot: true`, you may need\
      \ to explicitly set your own security context via values.\n"
    chart_updates: [Improved default security context in the Helm chart., Chart now
        validates configuration and fails installation if `settings.clusterName` is
        missing., ServiceMonitor template extended to support `relabelings` and `metricRelabelings`.,
      Chart securityContext defaults adjusted (including removal of `runAsNonRoot`).]

  summary:
    helm_changes: "## Helm / chart-related notes (what to watch during the upgrade)\n\
      \n- **CRD upgrade required (v0.37.0)**: v0.37.0 explicitly notes it **adds a\
      \ readiness condition to `EC2NodeClass`**, which means the **`EC2NodeClass`\
      \ CRD changes** and you must ensure CRDs are upgraded before/with the controller.\n\
      \  - In practice: apply the new CRDs first (or use the chart\u2019s CRD mechanism\
      \ if you manage them that way), then upgrade the Helm release.\n- **ServiceMonitor\
      \ template fix (v0.37.0)**: a chart bug fix corrects **ServiceMonitor indentation**.\
      \ If you use Prometheus Operator/ServiceMonitors, re-check that the rendered\
      \ YAML is valid and that metrics scraping works post-upgrade.\n- **Avoid duplicated\
      \ \u201CAH\u201D config (v0.37.0)**: chart bug fix notes an update to avoid\
      \ duplicating **AH config** (exact setting name not shown in your snippet).\
      \ If you\u2019ve set related values, compare rendered manifests before/after.\n\
      - **Helm generation bugs existed earlier (v0.34.0)**: v0.34.0 includes fixes\
      \ where Helm chart generation didn\u2019t run correctly for v0.33.0. This is\
      \ mainly historical, but it\u2019s a reminder to rely on the **version-matched\
      \ chart** for your target controller.\n\n> You didn\u2019t include the intermediate\
      \ v0.35.x/v0.36.x Helm changelog text, so double-check Helm values diffs for\
      \ those versions as well when you run the upgrade."

        generation issues present in v0.33.0 (mostly historical but emphasizes using
        the correct chart/version).']

        scheduling)., Interruption action metric now includes a **nodepool label**
