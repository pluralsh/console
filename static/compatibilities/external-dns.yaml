      \ `annotationFilter`** (instead of only via `extraArgs`). If you already set\
      \ annotation filtering via `extraArgs`, you can keep it, but consider migrating\
      \ to the new value for clarity/validation.\n- **`extraContainers` type change**:\
      \ `.extraContainers` changed to be an **array/list**. If you previously provided\
      \ it as an object/map, update your `values.yaml` accordingly.\n- **Gateway /\
      \ EndpointSlice RBAC adjustments in chart**:\n  - Ensure the chart version you\
      \ deploy includes the RBAC updates for **EndpointSlices** access (introduced\
      \ with the move from Endpoints\u2192EndpointSlices).\n  - Chart also fixes/adjusts\
      \ **RBAC for namespaced Gateway sources** and makes EndpointSlice permissions\
      \ more conditional. If you use Gateway API sources, double-check RBAC after\
      \ upgrade.\n- **Schema update**: Helm values schema updated to accept **`policy:\
      \ create-only`** as a valid type (useful if you want to prevent deletions).\n"
