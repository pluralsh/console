    helm_changes: "### Helm chart values / behavior changes to review\nFrom the notes\
      \ you provided, these are the chart-facing additions/changes between the controller\
      \ versions you\u2019re upgrading across (1.13.0 \u2192 1.14.0):\n\n- **`controller.metrics.serviceMonitor.scrapeTimeout`\
      \ (new)**\n  - If you use Prometheus Operator `ServiceMonitor`, you can now\
      \ explicitly set `scrapeTimeout`.\n  - Action: decide whether to set this (leave\
      \ unset to keep default behavior).\n\n- **`controller.service.trafficDistribution`\
      \ (new earlier in 1.13.x line)**\n  - Adds chart support to configure Kubernetes\
      \ Service traffic distribution.\n  - Action: only relevant if you want zone-aware/alternative\
      \ traffic distribution; otherwise leave default.\n\n- **`controller.service.external.labels`\
      \ and `controller.service.internal.labels` (new earlier in 1.13.x line)**\n\
      \  - Lets you add labels directly onto the created Services.\n  - Action: if\
      \ you previously patched labels post-install, consider moving them into values.\n\
      \n- **`controller.admissionWebhooks.certManager.*.revisionHistoryLimit` (new\
      \ earlier in 1.13.x line)**\n  - Action: review if you run cert-manager-based\
      \ webhook cert management and want to control rollout history.\n\n- **`runtimeClassName`\
      \ support (new earlier in 1.13.x line)**\n  - Action: if you use gVisor/Kata\
      \ or custom runtime classes, you can now set it via values.\n\n- **`activeDeadlineSeconds`\
      \ (new earlier in 1.13.x line)**\n  - Applies to Jobs (notably webhook patch/certgen\
      \ jobs).\n  - Action: set if you have strict job execution time policies.\n\n\
      - **Extra init containers templatable (1.14.0)**\n  - Chart now templates extra\
      \ init containers rather than treating them as static snippets.\n  - Action:\
      \ if you use `extraInitContainers`, re-render manifests (`helm template`) and\
      \ ensure output matches expectations.\n\n- **Resize policy added (1.14.0)**\n\
      \  - Chart includes container resize policy support.\n  - Action: verify this\
      \ does not conflict with cluster policy/PSA/OPA rules.\n\n- **Webhook patch\
      \ job volumes added (1.14.0)**\n  - Chart adds volumes for the admission webhook\
      \ patch job.\n  - Action: ensure your cluster policies allow these volumes;\
      \ check restricted environments.\n\n- **Chart pushes to OCI registry (1.14.0)**\n\
      \  - Distribution change: charts are available via OCI.\n  - Action: if you\
      \ pin chart sources, update your retrieval method (e.g., `helm pull oci://...`).\n\

    helm_changes: "## Helm/chart values you likely need to review\n\n### 1) Metrics\
      \ are **disabled by default** (important)\nFrom the 1.12 line, the controller\
      \ changed its default CLI flags:\n- `--enable-metrics` is now **disabled by\
      \ default**.\n\n**Impact:** If you rely on Prometheus scraping, ServiceMonitor,\
      \ dashboards, or alerts, you must explicitly re-enable metrics.\n\n**What to\
      \ do (Helm):** set the chart values that enable metrics for your deployment\
      \ (commonly under `controller.metrics.*`). In 1.12, the chart also introduced\
      \ `controller.metrics.service.enabled` \u2014 confirm it is `true` if you want\
      \ the metrics Service.\n\n### 2) ServiceMonitor / Prometheus integration changed\
      \ in chart\nThe 1.12 line includes chart work:\n- \u201CChart: Rework ServiceMonitor\u201D\
      \n- New `controller.metrics.prometheusRule.annotations`\n\n**Impact:** If you\
      \ use Prometheus Operator, re-check your existing `ServiceMonitor`/`PrometheusRule`\
      \ values and labels/selectors after upgrade.\n\n### 3) New/changed chart knobs\
      \ introduced between 1.12 and 1.13\nFrom the 1.13 line, notable chart values\
      \ include:\n- `controller.service.trafficDistribution` (ties to the new traffic\
      \ distribution feature)\n- `controller.service.external.labels` and `controller.service.internal.labels`\n\
      - `controller.admissionWebhooks.certManager.*.revisionHistoryLimit`\n- `runtimeClassName`\n\
      - `activeDeadlineSeconds`\n\n**Impact:** Mostly additive (not required), but\
      \ if you need these behaviors you can now configure them via values. Also, \u201C\
      Remove validation for removed API\u201D suggests older API checks were dropped;\
      \ if you had custom validation expectations, re-test.\n\n### 4) PodSecurityPolicy\
      \ removed from the chart (already in 1.12)\n- \u201C\u26A0\uFE0F Chart: Remove\
      \ Pod Security Policy\u201D\n\n**Impact:** If you were relying on PSP objects\
      \ from the chart (older clusters), they won\u2019t be installed anymore. Ensure\
      \ you have PSA (Pod Security Admission) or alternative policies in place.\n\n\
      ### 5) OpenTelemetry init container removed (chart/app packaging)\n- \u201C\u26A0\
      \uFE0F Images: Remove OpenTelemetry\u201D (init container/image removed; module\
      \ is built into controller image since v1.10)\n\n**Impact:** If you previously\
      \ enabled the chart\u2019s OTel init container/image, that path is gone; validate\
      \ your OTel configuration still works with the built-in module approach.\n\n\
      ## Recommended upgrade checks (values-focused)\n- Confirm `controller.metrics.enabled`\
      \ (or equivalent in your values) is explicitly set the way you want.\n- If using\
      \ Prometheus Operator, validate `ServiceMonitor`/`PrometheusRule` values after\
      \ the ServiceMonitor rework.\n- If you used PSP, remove PSP-related values/resources\
      \ and ensure PSA policies allow the controller to run.\n- If you used OTel via\
      \ init container/image, migrate to built-in module configuration.\n"

      \n### 1) Metrics are **disabled by default** (breaking)\nThe controller CLI\

      \n**Action:** if you scrape Prometheus metrics today, explicitly enable them\

      \ step.\n\n### 6) Global image registry option added\n- New value: `global.image.registry`\n\
      \n**Action:** if you mirror images to a private registry, you can now set this\
      \ once globally instead of overriding per-image fields.\n\n### 7) New/changed\
      \ miscellaneous chart knobs\n- `controller.progressDeadlineSeconds`\n- `controller.admissionWebhooks.service.servicePort`\n\
      - `controller.admissionWebhooks.service.servicePort`\n- `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy`\
