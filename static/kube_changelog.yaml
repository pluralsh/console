  summary:
    major_changes: ["Kubernetes v1.20 is a feature-heavy minor release (with 1.20.1\u2013\
        1.20.15 as patch hardening) highlighted by dockershim deprecation, GA promotions\
        \ (RuntimeClass, BoundServiceAccountToken/TokenRequest, CSI Volume Snapshots,\
        \ PID limits), APF enabled-by-default (beta), and significant networking/storage/controller\
        \ improvements plus multiple security fixes in later patches."]
    breaking_changes: [Dockershim is deprecated in 1.20 (not removed yet) and clusters
        should plan migration to a CRI-native runtime (containerd/CRI-O) and validate
        tooling/operations that assume Docker runtime APIs., API Priority and Fairness
        (APF) is enabled by default; do not run 1.19 apiservers with APF enabled in
        the same HA control plane as 1.20+ apiservers due to incompatibilities (upgrade
        control plane together)., 'Dual-stack Service API (alpha) changed shape: `ipFamily`
        replaced by `ipFamilyPolicy`, `ipFamilies`, and `clusterIPs` (gated by IPv6DualStack);
        manifests/tools targeting the old alpha fields need updating.', kube-apiserver
        insecure serving is effectively removed (insecure port/address flags no longer
        work; insecure port can only be 0) which can break legacy setups relying on
        unsecured local endpoints., Garbage collector behavior is made deterministic
        for invalid ownerReferences; objects that previously lingered may now be deleted
        (run ownerReference validation tooling pre-upgrade)., 'For CSI drivers, kubelet
        no longer pre-creates `target_path` for NodePublishVolume and no longer checks
        mount/corruption for staging/target; CSI drivers must be idempotent and perform
        their own verification.', Exec probe timeout handling was fixed; workloads
        relying on the previous buggy behavior may see changed probe outcomes unless
        temporarily disabling `ExecProbeTimeout` feature gate (future removal planned).,
      kubectl debug becomes a built-in command; any existing kubectl plugin named
        `debug` will be shadowed and must be renamed.]
    deprecations: [Dockershim (Docker runtime integration in kubelet) is deprecated;
        begin migration planning for runtime and operational processes., kubeadm control-plane

        update automation and tolerations accordingly., kubelet `metrics/resource/v1alpha1`
        endpoint removed/deprecated in favor of `metrics/resource` (client scraping/config
        updates needed)., EgressSelectorConfiguration type `Master` deprecated in
        favor of `controlplane` (removed in 1.22)., Windows Hyper-V container feature
        gate deprecated in 1.20 (removed in 1.21)., 'Various kubectl/kubeadm deprecated
        flags removed or slated for removal (e.g., kubeadm `--experimental-kustomize`
        removed; kubectl `--delete-local-data` deprecated).']
    removals: [PodPreset (v1alpha1) API and admission plugin removed; use mutating
        admission webhooks for equivalent behavior., kube-apiserver insecure port
        functionality removed (legacy flags no longer effective; will be cleaned up
        further in later releases)., Some deprecated scheduler metrics removed; migrate
        dashboards/alerts to replacement framework metrics., kube-proxy user-space
