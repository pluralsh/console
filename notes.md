Yes, you can set up a local AWS OpenSearch cluster using Docker. There are several approaches, depending on whether you want to emulate AWS services locally or run a standalone OpenSearch cluster.

### üß™ Option 1: LocalStack + OpenSearch

LocalStack is a cloud service emulator that allows you to run AWS services locally. By integrating it with OpenSearch, you can simulate AWS OpenSearch Service on your local machine.([Medium][1])

**Setup:**

1. **Docker Compose Configuration:**

   ```yaml
   version: '3.9'
   services:
     opensearch:
       container_name: opensearch
       image: opensearchproject/opensearch:latest
       environment:
         - node.name=opensearch
         - cluster.name=opensearch-docker-cluster
         - discovery.type=single-node
         - bootstrap.memory_lock=true
         - "OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
         - "DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN=true"
       ports:
         - "9200:9200"
       ulimits:
         memlock:
           soft: -1
           hard: -1
       volumes:
         - data01:/usr/share/opensearch/data

     localstack:
       container_name: localstack-main
       image: localstack/localstack
       ports:
         - "127.0.0.1:4566:4566"
       environment:
         - OPENSEARCH_CUSTOM_BACKEND=http://opensearch:9200
       volumes:
         - "./volume:/var/lib/localstack"
         - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"

   volumes:
     data01:
       driver: local
   ```



2. **Start Services:**

   Run the following commands to start the services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```



3. **Create OpenSearch Domain:**

   Use the `awslocal` CLI to create an OpenSearch domain:

   ```bash
   awslocal opensearch create-domain --domain-name my-domain
   ```



4. **Verify Cluster Health:**

   Check the cluster health:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
   ```



This setup allows you to interact with OpenSearch as if it were an AWS-managed service, providing a local development environment that mimics AWS OpenSearch Service. ([docs.localstack.cloud][2])

### üß± Option 2: Standalone OpenSearch Cluster

If you prefer to run OpenSearch without emulating AWS services, you can set up a standalone OpenSearch cluster using Docker.

**Setup:**

1. **Docker Compose Configuration:**

   ```yaml
   version: '3.9'
   services:
     opensearch:
       container_name: opensearch
       image: opensearchproject/opensearch:latest
       environment:
         - node.name=opensearch
         - cluster.name=opensearch-docker-cluster
         - discovery.type=single-node
         - bootstrap.memory_lock=true
         - "OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
         - "DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN=true"
       ports:
         - "9200:9200"
       ulimits:
         memlock:
           soft: -1
           hard: -1
       volumes:
         - data01:/usr/share/opensearch/data

   volumes:
     data01:
       driver: local
   ```



2. **Start Service:**

   Run the following command to start the OpenSearch service:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```



3. **Verify Cluster Health:**

   Check the cluster health:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
   ```



This setup provides a straightforward OpenSearch cluster without the complexity of emulating AWS services.&#x20;

**Recommendation:**

* Use **LocalStack + OpenSearch** if you need to develop and test AWS-specific features locally, such as IAM roles, VPC configurations, or other AWS integrations.

* Use a **Standalone OpenSearch Cluster** if you want a simpler setup focused solely on OpenSearch without AWS-specific configurations.
