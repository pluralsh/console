          NotificationSink defines notification delivery destinations for events routed by NotificationRouter.
          It represents the actual channels where notifications are sent, such as Slack webhooks,
          Microsoft Teams channels, or in-app notifications. NotificationSinks are referenced by
          NotificationRouter resources to determine where filtered events should be delivered.
