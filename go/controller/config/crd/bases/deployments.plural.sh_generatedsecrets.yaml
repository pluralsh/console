          GeneratedSecret handles templated secret creation and distribution.
          It allows you to define secret templates with variable substitution and automatically distribute
          the rendered secrets to multiple namespaces and destinations. This is particularly useful for
          sharing configuration, credentials, or certificates across multiple applications or environments
          while maintaining consistency and reducing manual secret management overhead.
