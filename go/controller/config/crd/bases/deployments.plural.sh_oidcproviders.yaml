          OIDCProvider configures OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication for external applications and services.
          It enables third-party applications to authenticate users through the Plural Console using the standard
          OIDC protocol. This is useful for integrating external tools, dashboards, or custom applications with
          Plural's authentication system while maintaining centralized user management and access control.
          Common use cases include connecting monitoring dashboards, CI/CD tools, or custom applications that
          need to authenticate users against the Plural Console's user directory.

                  CredentialsSecretRef references a Kubernetes Secret that will contain the generated OIDC client credentials.
                  Once the OIDCProvider is successfully created in the Console API, this secret will be populated
                  with the client ID and client secret needed for OIDC authentication flows.
                  The secret will contain two keys: 'clientId' and 'clientSecret'.

                  Each URI must be an exact match to be considered valid during the OIDC flow.
                  Common patterns include application callback URLs or localhost URLs for development.
